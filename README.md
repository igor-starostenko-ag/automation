Automation

To run it you will need install following gems: **Selenium-Webdriver, Capybara, Colorize**. (or if you have them, just skip this step)

Run the script you can with the command 

    ruby automation.rb

Note: In this script i'm using chrome browser

    Capybara.default_driver = :selenium_chrome
